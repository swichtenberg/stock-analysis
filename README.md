# VBA of Wall Street

## Project Overview
### Background
The project originated with a request for a tool to analyze the performance of stocks in the energy sector. After successfully demonstrating the capabilities of the VBA script previously written, the client requested the ability to analyze all stocks in the market in a similar fashion.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to refactor the existing VBA script to analyze data more efficiently, allowing more data to be analyzed in less time. Refactoring was particularly important as the client wished to greatly increase the dataset. It is expected the successfully refactored script will perform the same analysis on a dataset faster than the original script.

## Results
The analysis is well described with screenshots and code

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.
